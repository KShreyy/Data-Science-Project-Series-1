# Stock_pred
Approach
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the stock market dataset.
Visualized key statistics and trends in stock prices, such as the distribution of stock prices and the stock price over time.
Implemented a linear regression model to predict future stock prices based on the historical data.
Evaluated the model's performance using mean squared error and R-squared.

Methodologies
EDA: Utilized pandas and visualization libraries (matplotlib and seaborn) to explore the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights.
Predictive Modeling: Employed a linear regression model from the scikit-learn library to forecast future stock prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using mean squared error and R-squared metrics.

Insights
The stock prices exhibit a clear trend over time, with fluctuations and volatility observed in the data.
The distribution of stock prices is right-skewed, indicating that the majority of the prices are concentrated on the lower end of the range.
The linear regression model achieved a reasonable performance, with a mean squared error of [MSE] and an R-squared value of [R2]. This suggests that the model can provide useful predictions, but there is still room for improvement in the model's accuracy.
